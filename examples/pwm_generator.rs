//! 8-bit PWM sine wave generation on P9_29 (pru0_pru_r30_1).
//!
//! This example demonstrates:
//!
//! * PRU memory allocation,
//! * communication of data from host to PRU
//! * communication of data from PRU to host (and use of VolatileCell),
//! * two-way event signaling between host and PRU.
//!
//! The PRU code is designed to take exactly 10 PRU cycles per PWM subsamples independently of the
//! program flow. Since each PWM cycle is divided into 255 subsamples and the PRU is clocked at
//! 200MHz, the PWM frequency is approximately 78431Hz.
//!
//! The duty cycle of each subsample of the sine wave is specified as a fraction N/255 with
//! 0<=N<=255. The values N are stored in a 256-elements array allocated at 0x00000100 of the
//! local RAM of PRU0.
//! Other data exchanged between the host and the PRU is stored in a control struct allocated
//! at 0x00000000 of the local RAM of PRU0. The wave frequency is controlled by variable
//! `ctrl.sample_length` which sets the number of PWM sub-samples to be generated for any of the
//! 256 samples of the sine wave. Upon completion, the PRU writes the total number of subsamples
//! actually generated in variable `ctrl.sample_count`.
